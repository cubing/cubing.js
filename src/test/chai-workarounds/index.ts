 * This allows us to use `chai` with `web-test-runner`, because:
 *
 * - `web-test-runner` can't use `chai` directly, it wants "@esm-bundle/chai"
 * - The re-exported types from `@esm-bundle/chai` don't work without `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` (which we don't need otherwise, and therefore shouldn't enable)
 *
 * So we work around both issues here.
